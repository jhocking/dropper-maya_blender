# dropper4python

A very useful but unglamorous tool, a "dropper" is a simple level editor that lets you position objects in 3D space and then writes all the positions/rotations/etc. to an easily parsed text file. Your game can then read this file to put everything in the same place.

This is a pair of Python scripts that allow you to use either Maya or Blender as a dropper. It will export any custom attributes that you set, plus you can choose either JSON or XML for the output format. The included scene demonstrates how to setup objects for export.
